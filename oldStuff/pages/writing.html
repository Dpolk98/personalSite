            Some of my favorite authors are H.P. Lovecraft, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. They all tackle deep and powerful topics with fascinatingly engaging fiction. Lewis and Tolkien, as well as Dostoevsky,
            tackled the issues that were facing their religious beliefs during their lifetimes in ways that would transcend a mere rebuttle of their theological oppionents. Dostoevsky was the among the first existentialist philosophers, while Lewis and Tolkien
            launched the world into a craving for English myth, as well as setting the stage for the medieval fantasy setting so many people are familiar with today. Lovecraft is distinct from the other three, as he was a far different kind of thinker.
            His view of the world was that we were not creations of a loving creator, but small and insignificant things floating on a crumb of dust in space, much to the joy of modern cynics. His stories, however, do belie this concept in the end. His stories always
            show us the grandeur of his amazlingly detailed and creative universe through a human lens, an inescapable and fundamental flaw in his philosophy.
