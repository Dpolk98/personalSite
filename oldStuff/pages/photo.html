            Photography
        </h1>

        <p>
            Taking pictures used to be a seriously involved and limited profession, as recently as 100 years ago, photographers were a specialized field, much like scientists, authors, and artists.
            I discovered that I truly loved photography during a visit with my father in Arizona. We were walking around the town of Sedona, hiking on trails, and generally enjoying the day,
            when I found myself being extremly particular about the pictures I was taking with my fathers DSLR camera. I was thrilled when he bought me my own to use when I returned to Florida.
            Once I began taking photos in earnest, I found myself craving a more special kind of photo I remembvered from my youth, a film photograph. I bought an old Canon from a local thrift store, 
            and began taking pictures with Fujifilm Superia 400. The results of this experiment can be seen on my tumblr and Instagram accounts, linked below and on the homepage, as well as my
            personal favorites below. I like to imitate the impressionists of the mid 19th century, trying to capture the light of a scene in a way that may return me to that moment. This is the
            greatest advantage of film; it's ability to feel like a moment paused forever (quite an apt description considering the chemical process film undergoes when exposed to light).
            I also love to take pictures of buildings and urban life, as a man from rural Connecticut, the city is always a new and fascinating place to me.
