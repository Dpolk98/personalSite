            I was born in Connecticut in 1998, and enjoyed spending my summers living with my grandparents on their lovely New England farm.
            I moved to Florida in 2007, and after graduating high school, began working any job I could get. I had no plan for the future, until I reconnected
            with an old friend from middle school who introduced me to programming, whereupon i began my journey to become a web developer.
