        <p>
            Hiking is one of, if not the best, way to reconnect with nature. Humanity is a natural animal, and no matter how much we seperate ourselves from nature by our means
            of modern living, we will always need to be in touch with the home of our ancestors. There is, in my mind, nothing more simply sastisfying than a hike through an old, well travelled
            New England wood (This may terrify or thrill Lovecraft, it's quite hard to wrench such a niche opinion from a dead mans writings). Packing a backpack, and then actually taking that
            gear out into the field and using it is a great way to see what one is capable of, both in planning, and in execution.
