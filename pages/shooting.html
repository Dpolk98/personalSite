        <h1>Shooting</h1>

        <p>
            Firearms have been an integral part of American history (much like tobacco, both played either side of a moral issue at any given turn). I will not get into
            the moral or political arguments for or against gun ownership, though I believe my opinion is well defined regardless. I currently own an AR-15 from Palmetto State Armory,
            where I also purchased my second gun, also an AR-15. I once owned a Russian Mosin, made in 1944, I don't recall the factory that made it, unfortunately. 
            The AR-15 is perhaps the greatest design ever put to paper by any gun designer. John Moses Browning made all men equal, but Eugene Stoner made all men Superman.
            The weight, simplicty of it's function, ease of upgrading, both in terms of attachments as well as modernization, make the AR far superior to any other deisgn of
            it's time, as well as it's greatest competitor, the AK-47, or as it has become, the AK-M.
