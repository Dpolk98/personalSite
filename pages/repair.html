        <p>
            Repairing anything is a lot of fun (except for cars, those evil beasts). It's a test of skill, precision, knowledge, and above everything, patience.
            I enjoy fixing electronics more than most mechanical or analogue things because there's a distinct element of cool about it. If somebody see's you repairing 
            a fan or perhaps an old household appliance, they consider you a very handy person (no small compliment, especially today!), but if that same person sees
            you repair any kind of electric device, from a phone to any number of modern over-engineered appliances, they will more likely consider you not only handy,
            but also some kind of tech whiz. I don't think I need to go into detail of being considered such a thing, we're all familiar with the dopamine hit one gets
            from a compliment, especially one well earned.
