            Pipe Tobacco
        </h1>

        <p>
            Everyone has their vices, and all the more lucky is the man who is able to choose a vice. I have been quite happy to choose to smoke pipe tobacco,
            especially after my first experience smoking a cigar. My friends had brought me a cigar they purchased at Wawa, and encouraged me to try it. My mistake'
            wasn't, I feel, in the smoking itself, but rather the trust I had in my friends to teach me how to smoke. I knew to not inhale, and that one should take their time,
            but to what extent I had no clue. I ended up finishing the cigar before anyone else had finished theirs, and then had a disasterous trip to the bathroom. After that
            night, I swore off cigars (though I do occasionally take a puff of a friends cigar if it interests me). After a couple days of living in outright fear of my new
            mortal foe, I decided to try smoking again, but this time through a pipe. Much like repairing electronics, this decision was mostly motivated by a desire to be seen
            as cool, which I will always stand by. The second reason was that a pipe could hold less tobacco, and had the option of a filter. It was also a big help that a local
            tobacco store had a large selection of tobacco to choose from for pipe smokers, including a rum raisin blend that smells and tastes like Fig Newtons. I always find
            myself relaxed not just by the tobacco, but also the slow and methodical act of packing the pipe. This, combined with the sharpening (or at least percieved sharpening)
            of my mind by the plant makes my occasional smoke a well earned and joyful ritual.
